# ST_Equalization_LMMSE
Project belonging to EQ1220 Signal Theory

In this project we perform the equalization of a signal distroted by a channel of unknown impulse response. 
To derive the coefficient of the FIR filter used in the equalizer, Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimation (LMMSE) techniques have been used.
